# Wake Me Up! #

An alarm clock app for android that has two modes, simple alarms and alarms with questions.

- Simple alarms work the way alarms usually do, you set a time and the alarm goes off at that particular time.

- Alarms with question are a bit different. The user sets the time and enters some questions and their answers. When the alarm goes off, the user then has to answer those particular questions for the alarm to shut down.
